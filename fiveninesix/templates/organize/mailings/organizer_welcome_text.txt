{% autoescape off %}{% if not has_received_this_mailing %}Welcome to the Acres organizing community!{% else %}Hello again from the Acres organizing community!{% endif %}

You are now an organizer on {% include "organize/mailings/lot_info_snippet.txt" %}
{% if not has_received_this_mailing %}This{% else %}As you know, this{% endif %} means that any time someone adds information to the lot's page, you'll get an email like this. And it means that other folks who are interested in this lot can see your contact information on its page and may reach out to you directly.

STEP 1: Call the city agency listed above and on the lot's page to ask them about it. Here are some tips for your phone call: http://596acres.org/en/resources/advocacy-resources/

It would be great if you would add a note to the lot's page describing what you learned about the city's plans and what you know about the community's plans so that others can build on your knowledge.
