Thank you for getting involved in your community.

By now, you know what the city's plans are for the lot you are organizing. Sharing what you know is key to getting your community together. If you haven't yet, write a note on the lot's page describing what you have learned.

Now it's time for STEPS 2 & 3!

STEP 2: Make some signs describing what you know and what you want and post them on the fence of the lot.
STEP 3: Schedule a meeting to talk with the neighbors. Make a flier for that, post it on the fence and get it into the hands of people in the neighborhood. Here's an example flier to get you started: http://596acres.org/media/filer_private/2012/07/23/community_garden__template.pdf

Here's a review from earlier - STEP 1: Call the city agency listed below and on the lot's page to ask them about it. Here are some tips for your phone call: http://596acres.org/en/resources/advocacy-resources/
